[algoritmi.bg](https://algoritmibg.netlify.app) is a comprehensive online platform dedicated to delivering high-quality and easy to understand competitive programming lectures in Bulgarian. As computer science grows in popularity, a need has now emerged for a free resource related to algorithms and problem-solving. This website could serve as an introduction to the beautiful world of competitive programming or a reference for certain algorithms and techniques, offering explanations with various examples for every topic. It could also be used by teachers and professors for providing students with additional materials and code snippets for the Data Structures and Algorithms university course.

The website is still in development. 

The following features are still a work in progress:
- A news section (about updates of the website, new content, etc.);
- A section with general information about the website;
- Animated examples to go along with the lectures;
- Almost all of the lecture content.
